# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using **Linear Regression**, a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm.  
It helps understand how numerical features influence house prices and how regression models are evaluated.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on input features and evaluates its performance using error metrics.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Housing dataset (from scikit-learn or CSV-based dataset)
- Contains numerical features related to houses
- Clean dataset with no major preprocessing required

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- **Linear Regression**

---

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

1. Imported required Python libraries  
2. Loaded the housing dataset  
3. Performed basic data exploration  
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
5. Trained a Linear Regression model  
6. Made predictions on test data  
7. Evaluated the model using:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
8. Visualized Actual vs Predicted house prices

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures average squared difference between actual and predicted values  
- **R² Score:** Indicates how well the model explains variance in data

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open Jupyter Notebook  
2. Run the file `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`  
3. Execute cells sequentially to view predictions and evaluation metrics

---

## 📌 Output
- Predicted house prices
- Error metrics (MSE, R²)
- Visualization comparing actual vs predicted values
