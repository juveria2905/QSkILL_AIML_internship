# Student Emotion & Awareness Prediction 🧠📊

## Objective
To analyze student emotions and predict:
1. Disorder type using emotion-based text data (Classification)
2. Post self-awareness score using numerical and categorical features (Regression)

## Dataset
A sample student dataset containing:
- Emotion tags (text)
- Disorder type
- Pre and post self-awareness scores
- Group (Treatment / Control)

## Machine Learning Techniques Used

### Classification
- Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
- Text Processing: CountVectorizer
- Target: Disorder_Type

### Regression
- Algorithm: Decision Tree Regressor
- Target: Post_Self_Awareness

## Steps Performed
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Text vectorization
- Train-test split
- Model training and prediction
- Model evaluation
- Data visualization

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Result
- Successfully classified disorder types based on emotion tags
- Predicted post self-awareness scores with reasonable accuracy
